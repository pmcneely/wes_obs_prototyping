# wes_obs_prototyping
Source for prototype OBS-automation code. 

See the `git` documentation for submodule use [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

I fully expect to manipulate/rehsape the guts of the (really nifty looking) OBS tool in the submdule, so it's been [forked](https://github.com/pmcneely/obs-scene-transporter). Original source was under the MIT license, and original source link should be seen at that fork.
